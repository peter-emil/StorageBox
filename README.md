# StorageBox

StorageBox is a python module that you can use to de-duplicate data
among distributed components.

For example, let's assume you run a movie store. You have
voucher codes you'd like to distribute to the first 30 users who press
a button. You are concerned that some users might try to get more
than 1 voucher code by exploiting race conditions (maybe clicking the
button from multiple machines at the same time).



Here is what StorageBox allows you to do
```
# Setup Code
import storagebox


item_repo = storagebox.ItemBankDynamoDbRepository(table_name="voucher_codes")

deduplication_repo = storagebox.DeduplicationDynamoDbRepository(table_name="storage_box_deduplication_table")


# You can add items to the item repo (for example add list of voucher codes)
item_repo.batch_add_items(voucher_codes)


# You can then assign voucher codes to User IDs
deduplicator = storagebox.Deduplicator(item_repo=item_repo, deduplication_repo=deduplication_repo)

voucher_code = deduplicator.fetch_item_for_deduplication_id(
    deduplication_id=user_id
)
```
And that's it!

As long as you use a suitable `deduplication_id`, all race conditions
and data hazards will be taken care of for you. Examples of suitable 
candidates for `deduplication_id` can be User ID, IP Address, 
Email Address or anything that works best with your application.


## Prerequisites
To use StorageBox, you need the following already set up.

- An ItemBank DynamoDB Table, The current implementation requires the table to have 1 column
called `item`. This is where you will store items (in the case of the example:
voucher codes).
- A Deduplication DynamoDB Table, This will be used by `StorageBox` to achieve idempotency, 
that is, to make sure that if you call `fetch_item_for_deduplication_id` multiple times with
the same `deduplication_id`, you will always get the same result.

If you prefer to use something else other than DynamoDB, you can implement your own `ItemBankRepository`
and/or `DeduplicationRepository` for any other backend. This implementation will have to implement
the already established Abstract class. If you do that, contributions are welcome!


## Installation
```
pip install storagebox
```


## Other Example Use Cases
Hosting a big event and only have 10,300 seats that would be booked in the first few minutes?
```
# Before the event, add 10,300 numbers to the bank
item_repo.batch_add_items([str(i) for i in range(10300)])

# From your webserver
assignment_number = deduplicator.fetch_item_for_deduplication_id(
    deduplication_id=email
)
```

Are you an influencer and only have 5000 people to give special referral links to? (First 5000
people who click the link in the description get a free something!)
```
# Before you post your content
item_repo.batch_add_items(referral_links_list)

# From your webserver
referral_link = deduplicator.fetch_item_for_deduplication_id(
    deduplication_id=ip_address
)
```

Are you organizing online classes for your 150 students, you're willing to host 3 classes (50 students)
each but you'd like to be sure that no student attends more than 1 class?
```
# Before you host your classes
class_1_codes = storagebox.ItemBankDynamoDbRepository(table_name="class_1_codes")
class_2_codes = storagebox.ItemBankDynamoDbRepository(table_name="class_2_codes")
class_3_codes = storagebox.ItemBankDynamoDbRepository(table_name="class_3_codes")
deduplication_repo = storagebox.DeduplicationDynamoDbRepository(table_name="myonline_classes_deduplication_table")

class_1_codes.([str(i) for i in range(0, 50)])
class_2_codes.([str(i) for i in range(50, 100)])
class_3_codes.([str(i) for i in range(100, 150)])

# From your webserver
deduplicators = {
    'class_1': storagebox.Deduplicator(item_repo=class_1_codes, deduplication_repo=deduplication_repo),
    'class_2': storagebox.Deduplicator(item_repo=class_2_codes, deduplication_repo=deduplication_repo),
    'class_3': storagebox.Deduplicator(item_repo=class_3_codes, deduplication_repo=deduplication_repo),
}

deduplicator[requested_class].fetch_item_for_deduplication_id(
    deduplication_id=student_id
)

```
